              Once again, I realized that I was broke. It’s a state of mind that
              comes and goes, depending on how panicked I am about if I have
              enough money saved up. I definitely didn’t live in a broke mindset
              for the summer, when I unfortunately got a bit too excited about
              enjoying life. I took out a student loan that I try not to touch
              unless it’s an emergency, so I am not broke.</p>
              <p>
              What if my computer breaks? What if my camera breaks? What if I
              need a new anything? The loan is for that. But the savings I had
              on top ot that, as of today, hit zero. So therefore, I am broke.

          <section>
            <p>I have two separate thoughts on the matter.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <p>
              One is that if I’m honest I wasn’t trying to save money that much.
              First of all, I was a student, living on the bare minimum, and I
              did deserve a treat every once in a while. It’s not my fault that
              the ecomonical state of the world is crumbling, prices are through
              the roof, and I happen to live in one of the most expensive cities
              in the world. It does however still make me a bit nauseous that so
              much money disappeared somehow.</p>
              <p>
              There is a trend circling the social medias nowadays, which is
              called girl math. It’s more a meme than a trend but I don’t know
              if the fact that it’s relatable makes this better or worse. Girl
              math means the creative justification of any spending. I am a
              master of girl math.

              This year was a year of investments for me. I am very conscious
              about what I spend money on, but that doesn’t mean that I don’t
              spend a lot of money. I am just very good at picking the right
              things to spend it on, and the process includes days of analyzing
              every angle and exploring all the possibilities before swiping my
              credit card. This sometimes does send me to the edge of insanity,
              but at least saves me a lot of regrets. I hate regrets. This will
              be clear from my lifestyle.

              Evidently, I ended up with a lot of good investments: a
              comfortable huge double duvet for my double bed; the coolest
              bedside lamp (on my budget level); a new small analog camera that
              I have already used to take amazing photos with; good skincare
              items; an electric tootbrush (I collected some compliments from my
              dentist); and the latest, a pair of patent mary jane shoes that
              I’m in love with. I also look at food and eating out every once in
              a while as an investment. In a city where the cuisine tastes and
              looks like it was sent from the heavens, one simply cannot waste
              time not indulging in them. I would rather go broke but still have
              the luxury of eating Danish pastries.</p>
              <p>I will also consider any creative outlet as good investment.
              For the past year this meant spending money on painting equipment,
              rolls of film and their development, T-shirt printing, and Adobe
              subsription. This last one does give me heart palpilations, and
              kinda makes me feel the same way as airlines. Both suck an
              incredible amount of money our of you for basic neccessities.
              Sorry if I wanna go see my family every once in a while. And also
              for wanting to edit the photos I took.

              The other tought I had on the matter of being broke: I’m relieved.
              <br />
              If I’m broke I don’t have to make decisions about what to do with
              my money, because I have no money. I don’t have to feel bad for
              not investing, or not travelling, or not saving it up, or any of
              the million things you can do with your money.

              I have a wishlist that keeps me in a chokehold because I always
              have new ideas what to wish for, and then it puts me under
              pressure because I have to follow that up with actions. I wish for
              a cool vintage leather jacket, so I have to keep an eye out for
              one. I also wish for a new bike lock, because the current one is
              old and stupid and drips wet red stains on my shoes when it’s
              raining. The list continues with a new everyday shoe, a new Doc
              Martens, a winter coat, new tattoos, and so on. Every time I enter
              a shopping mall, I come up with ten new ideas for what I actually
              desperately need in my life. I don’t realize how desperately I
              need them unless I enter the mall, so I avoid doing that as much
              as possible.</p>
              <p>
              The point is, all items on my wishlist are heavily justified, and
              at this point there is no reason not to spend money on them, which
              makes me anxious, and evokes cancerous thoughts like I’ll only be
              happy once I obtain all of them. The problem is of course, that
              the list never ends and never going to end. Sometimes, when I
              consider myself broke, I delete some of it, but as soon as I don’t
              feel broke anymore, I add them back.

              The chokehold is released suddenly. I have no money to spend on
              any of them. There is no question about what to spend on because
              there is nothing to spend. And then I realized, I never actually
              needed any of them. At least not desperately. At least not right
              now.</p>
              <p>
              My relief about the wishlist made me realize that this chokehold
              is never going to change, because as long as there is money to
              spend, I will be anxious about what to do with it. And when I have
              a lot of money, the wishlist is gonna have more and bigger items
              to keep me in a chokehold. Coloring my hair every month. Doing my
              nails. Massages. Taking the taxi. Buying the designer bag.
              Expensive restaurants to try. Expensive hobbies to pick up.
              Spending a month in Tokyo. A house perhaps. A holiday house even.</p>
              <p>I don’t even consider any of these items right now, because
              they are so out of my budget. But once you level up, there is a
              whole new world of items unlocked. And once you level down, as I
              have now, some items become unavailable, and you feel a huge
              relief for not having to think about them.

              The phenomenon was studied even, why richer people are not
              neccessarily happier. Money has a hold on you and the bigger the
              money, the bigger the hold. The more options we have, the less
              likely we are to choose anything, because the risk of regret is
              higher. So often I feel like I can do anything, that it makes me
              do nothing. Even my freedom in unemployment is like that. Maybe we
              are just longing for fewer responsibilities.

              All I ever wanted to be is a grown up, with all the freedom of the
              grown up. I didn’t know how hard it would be when you have no one
              else to blame but yourself. We prefer situations where the
              responsibility of choice is not on us. We don’t know this, only
              subconsciously. Because we expect online stores to have thousands
              of brands with thousands of clothes and all available in our size,
              and streaming services with thousands of movies and tv shows, and
              music platforms with all of the songs ever made. But then whatever
              clothes we buy, we feel bad for the ones we didn’t buy, and we
              can’t watch one thing because we miss out on all the others, and
              I’m never happier to hear a song than when it comes on the radio,
              where it wasn’t my choice, and when someone tells me what movie to
              see, and when the store doesn’t have most shoes in my size.</p>
              <p>
              Weirdly enough, I am actually fine without having the items from
              my wishlist. I have enough clothes and got food on my table. My
              coffee is good enough, the cheap beer is good enough, all I have
              is actually, GOOD ENOUGH.</p>
              <p>
              Having money makes you question if they are though. Looking at
              what others have and what others are doing makes you question. And
              if you are in the financial situation, you’ll start getting the
              stuff others have and doing the stuff others are doing, because
              you are not sure if you’re missing out.

              Similarly, nothing makes you that happy if you feel like you have
              to get it. I remember, one of my happiest spendings was getting
              non-instant coffee and ingredients for making brioche after
              waiting two months to get paid. It felt so good because I was
              finally comfortable with spending money on them.</p>
              <p>
              And I spent a lot of money on a lot of things since, that I didn’t
              feel comfortable about. I questioned if I should, if I really
              needed it. Of course, as I just concluded, we rarely ever really
              need anything, so I ended up convincing myself that I could spend
              the money even if I didn’t need the thing. It almost never made me
              comfortable though and therefore, never as happy.

              I feel like there is a solution here somewhere. I feel I would be
              happier if I was always broke, having money only for emergencies.
              What if I remembered that all I have is good enough? Is it
              realistic that I’ll remember that? I could try. Only replacing
              something once it’s broken and dead and finished completely. Not
              upgrading just for the sake of the upgrade. Not spending more just
              because I have more. The happiest people probably have a broke
              mindset.
